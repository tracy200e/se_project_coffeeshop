# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Top-of-mind prompt: As the user scroll down to the menu, a pop-up prompt would be useful in nudging them to make a booking or an enquiry about the menu.
- More animation: When done with the right amount, animation can help breathe life into the website. Featuring a little bit more animation from the top of the page would not only make the visual experience more dynamic, but also match the level of animation in the "About the coffee shop" section.
